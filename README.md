# acs-starships
Catalog of Adventure-Class Starships for the Traveller RPG.

At a minimum, entries should be a design file in the T5DesktopShipyard data format, either in YAML, JSON, or XML.  If a suitable alternate format and shipyard program emerges (e.g. fully supporting a final .acs format), then that can be used instead. 

Preferably, these entries are also accompanied by a text file and HTML file of the design.
