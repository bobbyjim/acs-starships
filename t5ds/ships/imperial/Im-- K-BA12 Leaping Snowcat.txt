Touring Ship K-BA12 Leaping Snowcat MCr81.4


Using a 200-ton hull, the safari ship is an excursion vessel intended for trophy-taking (real or photographic) expeditions to other worlds. It has jump drive-B, maneuver drive-A, and power plant-B, giving a performance of jump-2 and 1-G acceleration. The ship is undertonned, resulting in Agility+1 and 2-G acceleration in atmosphere 2+. Fuel tankage supports one jump-2 and two months of operations. Adjacent to the bridge is a computer Model/1 bis. There are eleven staterooms and no low berths. The ship has one hardpoint and one ton allocated to fire control. A double turret is installed; the turret is mounted with twin beam lasers.

There are two ship’s vehicles: an air/raft and a 20-ton launch. Cargo capacity is 6 tons. Two 7-ton capture tanks hold specimens, and two 4-ton lounges are combined into a trophy lounge, serving as a hunter’s recreation area. The hull is airframed, and can be submerged.

The safari ship requires a crew of five: pilot, astrogator, engineer, steward, and medic. A gunner and additional expedition personnel may be added. The pilot operates the launch; the steward operates the air/raft. The ship can carry a party of six (or up to 8 if the crew goes to double occupancy) on expeditions; it does not engage in commercial passenger service.

Launch (also called Lifeboat): Using a 20-ton hull, the launch is capable of 3-G acceleration, carries 1 ton of fuel tankage, and has a crew of two. The craft has 15 tons excess space available for custom use, and costs MCr16.

Actual volume: 196.5 tons
Crew comfort:     +0
Passenger demand: +1
