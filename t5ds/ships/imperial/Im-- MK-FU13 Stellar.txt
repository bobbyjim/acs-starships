Subsidized Liner MK-FU13 Stellar MCr186.8


Using a 600-ton TL13 unstreamlined hull, the subsidized liner is a passenger and freight carrier committed to long-haul routes. It has jump drive-J, maneuver drive-C, and power plant-J, supporting 1 month of operations and giving performance of jump-3 and 1-G acceleration. Fuel tankage supports the power plant and allows one jump-3. Adjacent to the bridge is a Model/3 computer.  There are thirty staterooms and twenty low berths.  The ship has three hardpoints; no weapons are installed. There is one ship's vehicle: a 20-ton launch, carried in an internal hangar. Cargo capacity is 129 tons. The hull is unstreamlined and overtonnage; adding turrets will increase the overtonnage.

The subsidized liner requires a crew of nine: pilot, astrogator, three engineers, three stewards, and a medic. Up to three gunners may be added in bunks. The ship can carry 21 high or middle passengers and twenty low passengers. The pilot also operates the launch.

Overtonnage: 9 tons
Crew comfort:     +0
Passenger demand: +1
