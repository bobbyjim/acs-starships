Exploratory Trader AL-HS23 Lanthium Petal MCr253.1


Using an 800-ton streamlined hull, the Lanthium Petal class exploratory trader is intended for frontier speculative trade, with a strong emphasis on safety rather than profit-making. It is equipped with the LSP L/3 Starpoint jump drive, the Dupree 220m maneuver drive, and a Lesler-Khalan #155e power plant, giving performance of Jump-3 and 2G acceleration. Fuel tankage supports the power plant and one jump-3; fuel scoops and purification plants allow wilderness refueling. It has four triple turret beam lasers and two double turret sandcasters. A mining laser turret gives the ship flexibility to perform some prospecting. There are 250 tons of cargo.

The ship carries three craft: a fast boat and lifeboat in a hangar, and an air/raft stored in cargo. 

The ship requires 8 crew: Pilot, Astrogator, 4 Engineers, Sensop, and Medic. A Steward and up to 4 Gunners may be added. Four luxury staterooms are set aside for high passengers, or more likely, senior merchants, negotiators and salespeople. A laboratory is supplied for immediate analysis of local products.

A variant is the Aslan Spice Trader: a long-range cargo hauler that travels from the Hierate states to distant source markets, such as the Aramis Trace in the Spinward Marches. The Spice Trader has a downgraded maneuver drive and power plant, and lacks the pinnace and extra appointments, to bring cargo space up to 400 tons.
