Patrol Frigate PG-DA33 Daring MCr259


The Daring-class Type PG Patrol Frigate is an intermediate naval vessel deployed in a offensive role; the ship is tailored for long-term operations (patrol).

The 400-ton airframe hull is equipped with Landing Wheels and Lifters for limited hover and repositioning. It is enhanced with Wings (providing +1G in Atmosphere) and Folding Fins (Agility+1 in Atmosphere). In combat, the ship ideally sheds its two Fighters and Ship's Boat to create an undertonnage (348 tons) and Agility +2 (total in Atmosphere +3). The Folding Fins must be folded before the ship can land on a world surface. The Hull has two layer of Charged Armor. In addition to Armor, the Nuclear Damper-14 provides protection against nuclear weapons.

The drive suite has F-class drives, giving 3G (increased to 4G in Atmosphere) and Jump-3. The Jump Drive uses the Jump Bubble principle with standard Jump Flash. Fuel tankage includes 108 tons supporting one Jump-1 and 10 tons (tanked in the Wings) supporting operations for about a month. The ship has Fuel Scoops and Purifier.

The Bridge has four Consoles (Comms, Astrogation, Pilot, and Sensors) and Computer Model/4. An auxiliary Bridge forward has Consoles for Pilot and Astrogator. Thirteen other consoles support ship operations.

Crew consists of Captain (also Astrogator), six officers (Pilot, three Engineers, Medic, and Sensors Officer), eight Petty Officers, and 24 crew = 39 total crew supporting Level 1 staffing.
