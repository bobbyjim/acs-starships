Cruiser C-DB33 Enforcer MCr135.1


Using a 400-ton, TL12 hull, the Zirunkariish Enforcer is a generic naval vessel (marketed as a Cruiser; more appropriately called a Patrol or Picket) sold to poorer systems for routine operations.

It mounts jump drive-F, maneuver drive-F, and power plant-F, giving a performance of jump-3 and 3G acceleration. Fuel tankage supports a 3 parsec jump, at 40t per parsec, and one month of operations. Attached to the bridge is a Computer Model/3. There are 8 crew staterooms, four luxury passenger staterooms, and 10 low berths. A platoon barracks houses up to 22, including gunners and troops. Installed weaponry include two T3 Missiles and two T3 Beam Lasers. Cargo capacity is 5 tons; however, the ship's boats can each carry an additional 19 tons. The ship has a braced hull, and cannot skim fuel. Its boats can each skim up to 19 tons per hour.

There are two 25-ton Ship's Boats. The ship has 10 crew: pilot, astrogator, sensop, 3 engineers, 4 gunners, and a medic. It can carry 4 high passengers and 10 low passengers.
