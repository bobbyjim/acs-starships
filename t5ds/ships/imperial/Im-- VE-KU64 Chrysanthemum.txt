Destroyer Escort VE-KU64 Chrysanthemum MCr651.2


The Chrysanthemum class destroyer escort is a small, fast vessel intended for fleet and squadron escort duties. The design is old, but efficient, with examples of the ship serving in the Imperial Navy for over a century. Chrysanthemums are ubiquitous, being encountered with larger fleet elements as well as working alone.

This class of destroyer escort has been pressed into service in a variety of non-escort duties, including orbital patrols, police operations, garrison duties, and even limited strike missions.

Using a 1000-ton, TL15 hull, the Chrysanthemum class Destroyer Escort mounts jump drive-V, maneuver drive-Q2, and power plant-Q2, giving a performance of jump-4 and 6G acceleration. Fuel tankage supports a 4 parsec jump, at 90t per parsec, and 2 months of operations. Attached to the bridge is a Computer Model/6 fib. There are 6 staterooms, 10 rating niches, and no low berths. Installed weaponry include 2 T3 Missiles, 2 B1 Particle Accelerators, 1 B2 Fusion Gun, and 5 T3 Sandcasters. Cargo capacity is 10 tons. The ship has an unstreamlined hull, with scoops and intakes for frontier refueling. 

The ship carries 1 Modular Cutter. The ship has 16 crew. 

Actual volume: 928 tons
Crew comfort:     +0
