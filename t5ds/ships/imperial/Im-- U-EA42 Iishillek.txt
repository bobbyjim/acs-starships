Packet U-EA42 Iishillek MCr201.2


Using a 500-ton, TL12 hull, the Iishillek-class Packet mounts jump drive-E, maneuver drive-K, and power plant-K, giving a performance of jump-2 and 4G acceleration. Fuel tankage supports a 2 parsec jump, at 50t per parsec, and one month of operations. Attached to the bridge is a Computer Model/4. There are five empty hardpoints; the buyer is expected to purchase and install whatever weapons are needed. It has one ship's vehicle: an air/raft. The ship can fill its tank with pure fuel from gas giants (in a bit over 1 hour), water sources (in about three hours), or ice (in about six hours).

There is an officer's suite, 5 crew staterooms, two spacer niches, a gunners' barracks, 12 passenger staterooms, and 8 low berths. Cargo capacity is 80 tons. The ship is capable of wilderness, water, and submerged operations. Its airframe design gives it 5G performance in atmosphere 2+.

The ship requires a crew of 7: Pilot, Astrogator, three Engineers, a Steward, and a Medic. It can carry up to 5 gunners, 12 passengers, and 8 low passengers.
