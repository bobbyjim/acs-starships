Mercenary Cruiser CP-HU33 Broadsword MCr274.6


Using an 800-ton hull, the Broadsword class mercenary cruiser is built to carry small troop units for corporate or government operations. It has jump drive-M, maneuver drive-M, and power plant-M, giving jump3 and 3-G acceleration. Fuel tankage supports the power plant and one jump-3, some of which may be used for its smallcraft. Adjacent to the bridge is a computer Model/5. There are 25 staterooms and no low berths. Eight triple turrets are installed, four with beam lasers and four with missile launchers. There are five ship's vehicles: two modular cutters (with one open module and one fuel module), two ATVs (in ATV modules), and one air/raft. Cargo capacity is 80 tons. The hull is unstreamlined.

The mercenary cruiser requires a crew of eight: commanding officer, pilot, astrogator, four engineers, and medic. Vehicle pilots, clerks, troops, and gunners may be added. The ship can carry 17 passengers (42 if double occupancy) in non-commercial service; its primary intended purpose is transport and support of small military (mercenary) units.

Actual volume: 795 tons
