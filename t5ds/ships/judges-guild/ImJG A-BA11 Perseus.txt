Trader A-BA11 Perseus MCr52.5

Builder: Ling Standard
Owner: Judges Guild
Disposition: In Service

Using a 200-ton, TL12 hull, the Perseus-class Free Trader mounts A-series drives, giving it jump-1 and 1G acceleration. Fuel tankage supports a 1 parsec jump, at 20t per parsec, and one month of operations. Attached to the bridge is a Computer Model/1. There are 10 staterooms and 20 low berths. There are two empty single turrets. Cargo capacity is 82 tons. The ship has an airframe hull, with scoops, intakes, and bins for frontier refueling. It is also capable of wilderness and water landings.

The ship carries 4 crew -- pilot/astrogator, engineer, steward, medic, and can carry up to 6 passengers and 20 low passengers. Up to two gunners may be added, which would reduce the number of passengers carried.
