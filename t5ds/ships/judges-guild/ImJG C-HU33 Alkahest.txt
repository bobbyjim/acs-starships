Using a 800-ton, TL12 hull, the Alkahest-class cruiser mounts M-series drives, giving a performance of jump-3 and 3G acceleration. Fuel tankage supports a 3 parsec jump, at 80t per parsec, and 2 months of operations. Attached to the bridge is a Computer Model/5. There are 24 staterooms and no low berths. Eight empty triple turrets are installed. Cargo capacity is 80 tons. The hull is unstreamlined. 

Carried craft include 2 Pinnaces, 1 Air/Raft Enclosed, and 2 Heavy Grav Tanks. The ship has 7 crew. 

* - JG has ATV's listed. I used Grav Tanks for the equal volume. Adjust price accordingly.
